# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
I created a linked list constructor. this list object has various methods built into it. there is the includes method that will check and see if a value exists in your linked list. the insert method will add a new node to the end of the linked list. the print method prints out all of the head nodes contained within the list.

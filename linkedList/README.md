# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
a singly linked list is a list contining nodes that points to the next piece of data in the list.


## Challenge
I created a linked list constructor. this list object has various methods built into it. there is the includes method that will check and see if a value exists in your linked list. the insert method will add a new node to the end of the linked list. the print method prints out all of the head nodes contained within the list.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I followed along in the lecture video and deconstructed what he did in front of the class and then found solutions to the remaining methods required.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
list(): lists all of the values contained in the linked list.
insert(value): appends a new node to the end of the linked list.
insertBefore(newVal,val): inserts a new node into the link list before a given node.
insertAfter(newVal,val): inserts a new node into the link list after a given node.
includes(value): checks to see if a given value exists within the linked list.

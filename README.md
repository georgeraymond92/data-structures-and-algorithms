# Return index of given element in given array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge was to write a function with two parameters. An input array and a value. The function should take use a binary search function to find the element given's position within th given array then return it's index.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
In our solution we checked to see if the center element was greater or less than the element given. Then we looped either up or down accordingly to check for the position of the element in the given array. We then returned the index once the element was found.
